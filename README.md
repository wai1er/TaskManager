## About

This project is an implementation of API functionality that allows to perform CRUD operations on a database using FastAPI, sqlite and sqlalchemy. 
The database includes tables of tasks and users, each of whom has the ability to perform operations only on their tasks. 
To implement this, the functionality of registration, authentication and authorization of users was written. 
JWT is used as the authentication method.
You can see the handlers and the scheme, provided by the Swagger UI below.
